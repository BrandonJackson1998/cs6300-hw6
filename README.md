# CS6300 Homework 6: Fitness & Training Coach Agent

A comprehensive AI fitness coaching system that provides personalized workout recommendations, exercise guidance, and training assistance.

## Overview

This project implements a **Fitness & Training Coach Agent** with multiple specialized capabilities:

- **Exercise Recommendation Engine**: RAG-powered exercise search with 4,125+ fitness exercises
- **Conversational Fitness Coach**: ReAct agent with natural language interaction and tool use
- **Workout Planning Tools**: Schedule validation, duration estimation, and rest day analysis
- **Automated Evaluation**: LLM-as-a-judge with comprehensive quality metrics

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**  
  Make sure you are using Python 3.12 or later.

```bash
python3 --version
```

- **API Keys (stored in `.env`)**  
  You will need API keys for the LLM services:

1. **Gemini API key** (Required for ReAct agent)
   - Create via [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) â†’ "Get API key"  
   - Save in `.env` as:  
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     ```

2. **LangSmith API Key** (Required for ReAct agent tracing)
   - Create via [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/)  
   - Save in `.env` as:  
     ```
     LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
     ```

**Note**: The RAG agent (`make query`) works without these keys. The ReAct conversational agent (`make react`) requires both API keys.

## Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**

Mac:
```bash
make .virtual_environment
source .virtual_environment/bin/activate
```

2. **Install dependencies**

On Mac:
```bash
make install-mac
```

On Linux (teacher's original setup):
```bash
make install
```

---

### Build Vector Database
```bash
make index          # Processes 4,125+ exercise documents
```

### Run the RAG Agent
```bash
make query          # Start exercise recommendation interface
```

### Run the ReAct Agent (Conversational Coach)
```bash
make react          # Interactive AI fitness coach with tool use
```

The ReAct agent provides:
- Natural conversation about fitness and exercises
- Automatic tool selection (exercise search, schedule validation, duration estimation)
- Workout planning with intelligent recommendations
- Rest day validation and time management

### Setup Evaluation (Optional)
```bash
make ollama-setup
```

This installs Ollama and Llama 3.2 for automated quality assessment with detailed scoring.

### Development Commands

```bash
make explore          # Analyze exercise datasets
make test-tools       # Test tool wrapper functions
make clean           # Clean generated files
```

## Usage Examples

### RAG Exercise Search (`make query`)

Direct exercise search with semantic matching:

```bash
# After running 'make query', try:
"chest or shoulder exercises with dumbbells"
"best back exercises for strength training"
"Show me shoulder workouts with dumbbells"
"I need back exercises for strength training"
"What leg exercises can I do at home?"
"Upper body exercises with high ratings"
"Core strengthening exercises with detailed instructions"
```

### ReAct Conversational Coach (`make react`)

Natural conversation with intelligent tool use:

```bash
# After running 'make react', try:
"I want to build a chest and back workout plan"
"Create a 5-day workout schedule for me"
"How long will a workout with bench press, squats, and deadlifts take?"
"Is my schedule good? Monday: Chest, Tue: Rest, Wed: Back, Thu: Rest, Fri: Legs, Sat: Rest, Sun: Rest"
"Show me shoulder exercises and estimate the workout time"
"What day is it today and what should I train?"
```

The ReAct agent automatically:
- Searches for exercises when you ask about workouts
- Validates schedules for proper rest day distribution (max 2 rest days recommended)
- Estimates workout duration including warm-up, exercises, rest, and cool-down
- Gets current day when planning schedules

## Available Make Commands

```bash
# Environment Setup
make install-mac        # Install on macOS with Homebrew
make install           # Install on Linux/Ubuntu with apt

# Data & Indexing
make explore           # Explore the fitness exercise datasets
make index             # Build vector database from exercise data

# Running the System
make query             # Interactive fitness exercise recommendation agent
make react             # Interactive ReAct agent (conversational coach)
make test-tools        # Test tool wrapper functions

# Evaluation Setup (Optional)
make ollama-setup      # Complete Ollama + Llama 3.2 setup
make ollama-install    # Install Ollama only
make ollama-start      # Start Ollama service
make ollama-stop       # Stop Ollama service
make ollama-status     # Check Ollama status

# Evaluation Commands
make generate-queries  # Generate test queries for evaluation
make evaluate          # Run evaluation with detailed explanations
make evaluate-quiet    # Run evaluation without displaying explanations

# Maintenance
make clean             # Clean generated files
make clean-index       # Remove vector database only
make clean-all         # Deep clean including virtual environment
```

System configuration is handled directly in the code where needed.

### Evaluation Framework âœ…

The evaluation system provides comprehensive assessment of RAG response quality with beautiful visualizations and detailed feedback.

#### Features
- **Automated LLM Evaluation**: Llama 3.2 judges final RAG responses (not just retrieved documents)
- **Beautiful Progress Bars**: Visual scores like `â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘ 8.0/10`
- **Detailed Explanations**: Comprehensive reasoning for each score
- **Timestamped Logs**: All results saved to `logs/` folder with timestamps

- **Multiple Metrics**: Retrieval metrics + LLM quality assessment

#### Evaluation Workflow
```bash
# 1. Generate diverse test queries
make generate-queries

# 2. Run evaluation (shows detailed explanations)
make evaluate

# 3. Or run quietly (explanations saved to logs but not displayed)
make evaluate-quiet
```

## ReAct Agent Workflow

The ReAct agent follows a **Thought â†’ Action â†’ Observation** loop:

### Example: Creating a Workout Plan

**User**: "Create a 5-day workout schedule for me"

**Agent Reasoning**:
1. **Thought**: User wants a weekly workout plan. I should create a schedule and then validate it for rest days.
2. **Action**: `get_current_day()` to start from today
3. **Observation**: "Monday"
4. **Thought**: Now I'll create a balanced 5-day split and validate rest days
5. **Action**: Create schedule with appropriate muscle groups
6. **Action**: `validate_rest_day("Monday: Chest, Tuesday: Back, Wednesday: Rest, Thursday: Legs, Friday: Shoulders, Saturday: Arms, Sunday: Rest")`
7. **Observation**: "Valid schedule. You have 2 rest days in the week."
8. **Thought**: Should estimate workout duration for each day
9. **Action**: `estimate_workout_duration("Chest exercises: Bench Press, Incline Press, Flyes")`
10. **Observation**: "Estimated workout duration: 45-55 minutes..."
11. **Final Answer**: Complete workout plan with validation and time estimates

### Tool Usage Guidelines (from Agent Prompt)

The agent is instructed to:
- **Always validate** any weekly schedule with `validate_rest_day`
- **Always estimate** workout duration when creating workout plans
- **Use `exercise_lookup`** for all exercise-related queries
- **Break down complex requests** into multiple tool calls
- **Provide context** and explanations with recommendations

### LangSmith Tracing

Every agent interaction is traced in LangSmith (project: "fitness-react-coach"):
- Full reasoning chain (Thought/Action/Observation loops)
- Tool inputs and outputs
- Token usage and latency
- Error handling and retries
- Metadata: input length, model name, timestamp

To enable tracing, ensure `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` is set in `.env`.
